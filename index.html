                            My name is Yuxuan He and I am from Inner Mongolia in the north of China, where dairy products are as abundant as in Australia. This is my first year at RMIT, majoring in Information Technology, and I am currently in my third year of university, having spent the first two years in China. Now I am taking all my classes online.
                            I like to watch comedy or suspense movies and play games, my favorite games are Call of Duty and League of Legends and some multiplayer fun games. I have been playing League of Legends for the longest time, about 8 years.
                            In life, I like to make a To-do list so that I can clearly understand what to do and the deadline for each thing, and I do the same in my studies, but I always finish it in the last few days.
