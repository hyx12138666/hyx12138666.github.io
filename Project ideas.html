                <h2>Project ideas</h2>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Project Idea is a battle royale type of online game, where hundreds of players search for supplies and develop tactics in a specific area at the same time, and the last surviving team or individual wins. PUBG is different from the usual PUBG in that it has a weather system, time system and body state system that are closer to reality. This game will affect the effect of weapons and the sound of footsteps in different weather, and the light will change with time, affecting the player's vision, for example at night. It will also have more buildings and facilities, such as downtown with dozens of floors of buildings, stadiums, mountains, farms, planes, cars, bikes, subways, submarines, and more. There are also more advanced weapons.
                <br /><br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motivation for this project is because there is no battle royale online game on the market that I can really satisfy. For example, PUBG, since its launch 4 years ago, the current version has only increased some guns and their accessories and maps than the one just launched, no novelties appear, and over time, players get tired of playing, which is why many players of PUBG have decreased instead of increased for a large period of time. And my conception of this game, there are many other all the network without novelty things, as well as the late in addition to increase the basic map guns, will also be in the nature of the battle royale extended Shen some mode to keep players enthusiastic.
                <br><br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This game requires the creation of a personal real information account, because this kind of game hangouts will be very much, once the cheating behavior, all accounts of this person will be blocked to maintain a good game environment. After logging into the game, you can choose the image of your character including body type, issue, height, tattoos, clothes, etc. You can also change the image of your character later. Game mode to the most classic Battle Royale for example, a game can have 300 people participate at the same time, the player can have his squad of 2-4 people, each person can choose a career, different careers have different unique skills, for example, medical soldiers can give treatment to teammates, engineering soldiers can interfere with the enemy's radio, infantry is the classic assailant, etc.. After entering the game, players can choose to take a fixed route aircraft airborne down or by boat to come here, of course, there is no essential difference between these two ways, just different locations. Players need to fight against other players in the ever-shrinking safety zone to keep themselves alive until the end. Players can find supplies in any random place, such as anti-personnel weapons (rifles, shotguns, sniper rifles, grenades, rocket launchers, mines, etc.), functional props (smoke grenades, flashbangs, tear gas, radar, drones, etc.), and gun accessories, scopes to see better, silencers to muffle your firearm, added stocks to make the gun more stable, and even the ability to add Howitzers and so on, but the more accessories you add the heavier the gun will be, affecting the speed of lifting the gun and walking speed. In different weather, there are different effects on the player, for example, in snowy days, the line of sight will be affected and the sound of footsteps will change; if the wind is too strong, it will also affect the direction of the bullets. At night, night vision goggles can be installed to spot enemies. If the player walks or runs for a long time, the body will strain and the travel speed will slow down, you can recover your strength by walking slowly or use energy potions to recover quickly. Of course, most of the supplies on this can be purchased in the stores on the map, you can eliminate the enemy or search for supplies or even sell their existing things to get money. Survive to the end to win. By completing the game you can get coins, which can be used to change your image, paint your favorite guns, put drawings on them, and assemble charms. Players who have been in the battlefield for a long time will also improve their physical qualities and will increase their stamina and strength accordingly, but for the sake of fairness in the game, players with similar physical qualities will only be matched together.
                <br /><br />
                In addition to Battle Royale mode, there are other more casual modes, for example, the only supplies on the map are shotguns, which means that players can only fight at close range, or the whole game is in the dark, so that night vision will be a very precious supply and much more frightening.
                <br /><br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tools and Technologies
                OpenGL ES - OpenGL has long been the industry standard for high quality representation of 2D/3D graphics for a wide range of devices. openGL ES provides the underlying API interface between software applications and software graphics engines.
                Maya - it is one of the industry's preferred 3D animation software, it is very powerful, can be used for high-end computer graphics, and can handle almost any 3D production work. For example, model building, animation, depiction rendering, movie effects, etc.
                Havok - this is one of the more advanced physics engines available, it allows games to simulate reality and can make them very realistic.
                Unreal Engine - this is a more complete game development engine that provides a more versatile level editor, transitional animation system, 3D graphics and AI
                VS - Microsoft's VS IDE has been the basic software for game production for many years, with a user-friendly interface and a full range of features that can greatly improve coding speed and workflow
                <br /><br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Skills Required<br/>
                In special effects design, need to have good art training, color sense and rhythm, proficient in production software and engine particle system, will 2D hand-drawn animation production
                Graphic engineering, to develop various graphic technologies based on UE4 (including but not limited to interactive fluids, procedural generation, hair system, etc.) to host 3A quality action games, respond to their graphic technology needs, and participate in performance optimization, improve the art production process, develop various tools, and improve the quality and efficiency of art production
                In terms of technical art, produce advanced rendering effects used in various host 3A games (e.g. interactive snow, water, smoke; various weather effects; high-detail terrain materials, etc.)
                <br /><br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the development is successful, this will once again set off the players' craze for battle royale games, with diverse gameplay, closer to reality, so that players have an immersive feeling, and efforts to do a good job of maintaining the game and launching new gameplay and activities regularly. The method of registering with personal information and daily game detection will greatly reduce the appearance of hang-ups and completely focus on player experience, so that it will be better and better.
