                    <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
                    My interest in IT started when I played a game called Cross Fire in junior high school, a gun game, that is a lot of plug-ins, I have also tried, but play more always have not satisfied, so I searched for ways to do their own plug-ins, so I first learned about a programming language called EPL (Easy Programming Language), it is to Chinese As a program code programming, so easy to learn, but after learning for a while found that do hangouts or need to accumulate a lot of knowledge, so I slowly do not learn.
                    Later, I chose a computer-related major in university, and I hope I can continue to study game-related majors in the future. RMIT is one of the international partner institutions of BNUZ in my first two years, and I have never been to Australia, and I also learned that RMIT has a long history and high employment rate, so I chose RMIT, and I hope to learn more about game design or interaction design during my study.
