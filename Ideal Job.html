            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a job posting for an online game designer, my ideal job is similar to this one, it wants an experienced Unity developer to design a series of educational games for students so that they can understand the course content and practice it more efficiently, the minimum requirements are Unity and Unreal experience as well as webGL and C# experience and cross platform development, Git experience, User Interface and User Experience. Experience in 3D modeling in Blender or Maya and VR development, as well as use of PHP and databases and understanding of level design would be a plus. I think a job like this requires 3-5 years of experience. Most game designers need to be able to use Unity or Unreal because they are the dominant game development platforms and I don't know how to use them, so Unity or Unreal is an essential skill if you are applying for a game designer position. I have studied C, Java, C# and python, but I feel they are all skin deep, and I don't have any experience about game development, so first of all, I want to learn one of them first, through future courses or network materials, etc. Secondly, I also want to learn UI and UX, although I have studied C# before, there is still a big gap for game production, or I want to continue to learn more If there is a chance, it is better to go to some big game factory internship, such as Riot, Blizzard, etc. This is the best way to get professional experience.
